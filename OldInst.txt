# Rename setpath.txt to setpath.bat and place setpath.bat in the root of C:
# Place the Jaguar folder in the root of C:\ 
# Place setpath.bat in the root of C:\ - take a look at its contents, you may #want to use a different drive. 


# In the Root of C:\Jaguar if not already there place the following folders:
devkit
PadTheTempBins
src
Temp

# These folders are all crucial to the Windows enviroment.
# If you are using Linux the files needed for your enviroment are provided.
# Instructions are similar but way less cumbersome.  

Install Python if you dont have it.
Install DoSBox 74-3 - the VERSION WE INCLUDED :-)

DosBox Instructions:
type the following:

mount C C:\

C C:\

setpath

STEP 1
make clean
#cleans folders and preps init.o since we are still using init.sav to init.o

STEP 2
#TO BUILD THE DOOM GAME FOR JAGUAR # must start by creating doom.abs

make jagdoom   		(or just)   make     as its first on the list.

# compiles the doom.abs
# Note:  In WINDOWS ONLY DosBox runs out of table memory when #moving the #temp files around.
# DosBox and DosBoxX will both crash with a warning that says "Not Enough #Memory for Internal Tables".
# Reopen DosBox and use make command again, do this until it spits out #doom.abs
# From the beginning of the process if you open DosBox and do make clean, #then make it should only crash once, and does NOT effect the compile #process.


STEP 3

make boot 

#creates needed bootfiles
boot.abs

	
STEP 4
	
make rom:

#this merges the boot.abs and doom.abs, after this we need to pad it to 256k - 
#Linux does not do the padding outside of make!

	del C:\Jaguar\Temp\temp1.bin C:\Jaguar\Temp\temp2.bin C:\Jaguar\Temp\temp3.bin C:\Jaguar\Temp\JagDoomT.j64
	copy /b Univ.bin+boot.abs+doom.abs C:\Jaguar\Temp\temp1.bin

# Pause to run C:\jaguar\PadTheTempBins\PadTempBin1 Py on your desktop in cmd
# run PadTempBin1 on desktop cmd - this pads the temp1.bin to 256k in rom format
# DO NOT RUN PatTempBin2 


STEP 5

make rom2:

#merges the padded rom with the doom.wad file.
	
	copy /b C:\Jaguar\Temp\temp1.bin+doom.wad C:\Jaguar\Temp\temp2.bin
	copy /b C:\Jaguar\Temp\temp2.bin JagDoomT.j64	

#creates the rom
JagdoomT.j64







#Put Rom on GameDrive or in Emulator and play with your learning!





Tools Provided:

getthehex2v1.py and 3v1(not needed yet)
place the rom in a folder with this script, update the paths at the top with notepad or notepad++
Example:
DOOM_BIN_PATH = r"C:\GetTheHex\JAGDOOME.J64"  # Path to the binary file to search for the IWAD marker
JAGONLY_C_PATH = r"C:\GetTheHex\jagonly.c"    # Path to the source code file (jagonly.c) to update
Version 3v1 updates boot.s in the event the doom.abs exceeds 256KB
if it does, the padding files will need changed as well.  current filesize is 245KB
run the py in cmd - make sure you have python installed.
This will show you all three IWAD offsets
Make needed adjustments for jagonly.c, and also update jagonly.c if you move it into the same folder or map it to the directory you want update.  

python 
for 64 bit windows

DoSBox 74-3 and old Jagdev102.exe
provided as well.  If you install jagdev.exe it will install folder and files on C:\Jaguar
Delete whats in C:Jaguar and put this enviroment in its place.

rename setpath.txt
setpath.bat
Place this file in the root of your C:\ drive.
