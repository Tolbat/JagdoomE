# Doom for the Atari Jaguar - Extended Edition JagdoomE

This project allows you to build Doom for the Atari Jaguar in Windows 10. It uses the latest toolchain released by Atari which was put into the Public Domain. You can read about the Jaguar saga elsewhere - we're just concerned with Doom. 
We can thank Carl Forhan from Songbird Productions for that. 
He talked Carmack into releasing the Jaguar source, then played with it enough to get it to work on real hardware, then released the source for others to play with.

Having never worked on Doom for any platform, I decided after waiting for an eternity, to give it a try.  
Began using the work Saturn posted back in 2015, and then luckily got the assistance of ChillyWillyGuru.
It fell on the Green Lizard to revive the old Windows DOS build.  It presented some limitations.  
While it is easier and takes less steps in Linux, Windows is quite capable of producing a rom.  The biggest issue is DoxBox and how it manages table memory.

## Additional Tools Required for Windows
DosBox 74-3

Python for windows

GetTheWad.py - provided by Tolbat

PadTempBin1.py - provided by Tolbat

## Creating your Doom IWAD file
Assuming you don't already have the wad file for the game, but you DO have the original
Jaguar Doom rom image (not provided!), copy the Jaguar Doom rom image into the
C:\jaguar\GetMyWad directory, and make sure it's named "Doom.j64". 
You can then create the wad file by running GetTheWad.py it will then be placed in C:\jaguar\src
Now you have your wad file!

## Setting up the Enviroment:
In this example we will use the root windows directory C:\  
You may use any drive you wish but you will need to update all the different filepaths yourself.

Place the Jaguar folder in the root of C:\
Place setpath.bat in the root of C:\
open DosBox 74-3 and type 

```
mount C: C:\ 
```

A warning will appear, ignore it.

```
setpath 
```

You should now see the prompt change to C:\Jaguar\Src


STEP 1
First we need to prep the build enviroment.  Lets clean it and prep init.sav to become init.o

```
make clean
```


STEP 2
#TO BUILD THE DOOM GAME FOR JAGUAR # must start by creating doom.abs

```
make jagdoom
```

Note: In WINDOWS ONLY DosBox runs out of table memory when moving the temp files around.
DosBox and DosBoxX will both crash with a warning that says "Not Enough Memory for Internal Tables".
Reopen DosBox and use make jagdoom command again, do this until it spits out #doom.abs
From the beginning of the process if you open DosBox and do make clean, then make it should only crash once, and does NOT effect the compile process.

Now that you have doom.abs we can continue.


STEP 3

```
make boot 
```

creates needed bootfiles
boot.abs


STEP 4

```
make rom:
```

This merges the boot.abs and doom.abs, after this we need to pad it to 256k
Linux does not do the padding outside of make!


STEP 5

Open the cmd prompt on your windows 10 environment - NOT DosBox and change directory to:  C:\jaguar\PadTheTempBins
Run PadTempBin1.py
This pads the temp1.bin to 256k in rom format


STEP 6

```
make rom2:
```

merges the padded rom with the doom.wad file.
creates the rom
JagdoomT.j64

#Put Rom on GameDrive or in Emulator and play with your learning!


## New Controls

C/B/A/PAUSE/OPTION remain as set in the game. The differences arise in the
number pad, which also affects the ProPad controller.
```
1 = select PISTOL
2 = FORWARD
3 = select SHOTGUN
4 = STRAFE LEFT
5 = BACKWARD
6 = STRAFE RIGHT
7 = select CHAINGUN
8 = select MISSILE LAUNCHER
9 = select PLASMA RIFLE
* = toggle between FIST/CHAINSAW
0 = select BFG9000
# = select AUTOMAP
* + # = reset game
```
4 and 6 are the same as the LEFT and RIGHT shoulder buttons on the ProPad, which
is why they are set for strafing. I set 2 and 5 to forward and backward because
I will be adding mouse support, and having those four buttons arranged as they
are will make it easier to play like using a keyboard and mouse on the PC. The
buttons 7, 8, and 9 map to the ProPad buttons Z, Y, and X, respectively. This
gives you quick access to the heavier weapons in Doom. I decided not to put the
BFG in there as it usually has limited ammo, so you really don't want to be 
accidentally selecting it. Likewise, selecting the fist or chainsaw is fairly
rare, so it could be one of the out-of-the-way buttons. When Doom 2 support gets
added, the SHOTGUN button will toggle between the shotgun and the super shotgun.
Note that you don't NEED a ProPad controller. It will work fine on a normal
Jaguar pad. You just don't have shoulder buttons, nor Z/Y/X.


The pad controller goes into port 1. When mouse support is done, it will plug
into port 2. You will need an Atari ST or Amiga mouse with appropriate adapter,
or a PS/2 mouse with appropriate adapter for upcoming mouse support.

## Additional Tools for later
getthehex2v1  - finds the iwad offset and updates jagonly.c

getthehex3v1  - finds the iwad offset and updates jagonly.c and boot.s

Note - These may be useless but they can find the WAD file if for some reason its smaller, may need more work to logic.

## Acknowledgements
```
John Carmack for writing such an awesome game, and releasing it to the public.
Carl Forhan for arranging the code, and doing the initial work to get it
running.
CyranoJ for fixing the offset in the HUD in the code released by Carl.
Saturn for his work on the Windows build back in the days of Skunk.
ChillyWillyGuru for providing the cleaner Linux build, makefile, new controls,
and his improvements.
JagChris for organizing and planning
Atari Age for providing the original source code online
To the entire Jaguar Community that like me are forced to live in silence!

## Known Bugs

The init.s file needs some work. It didn't work as it came from Carl. ChillyWilluGuru made
some changes that get it working in BigPEmu, but it doesn't work on a real
console - yet. Chilly will work on it until it does, but until then, we use Carl's
workaround to handle the initialization code.

The network code is still as it was - kinda buggy. Chilly doesn't know if or when he
will get to it. He only has one Jaguar, and the JagGD cart is not compatible
with JagLink in any case.

## TIME SAVER for DOSBox

Insert the following into the [autoexec] portion of the dosbox-0.74-3.conf file - this speeds 
things up.
