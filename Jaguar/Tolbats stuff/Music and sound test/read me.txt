this code has bad sound effects, however it does allow for music and volume sound changes.

As they are currently linked in the options menu with current code - 3-18-2025 - using the optional volume scroll in the options screen will crash the game when added together.
Once separated this may be one way to control music volume in game.  It worked when tested with Chilly's code otherwise.

Note this is not a drop and go or copy and paste solution, you need to know a little about whats what here before trying it.
